AI Agent is a LLM-powered system. It extends classic prompt-based 'chat' and 'RAG' LLM applications with additional capabilities:

## Task execution

Agents can request to call external systems via API or execute a block of code. This gives them ability to interact with the environment to gather information or execute actions and observe their results. Technically, it works by LLM returing a request to execute an action. The call itself is conducted by an agent coordinator, like [LangGraph]({{< ref "posts/langgraph">}}).

### Code exeution

Code exection requires using sandboxes, because code generated by LLM may not be safe or may require specific features. There are a few sandboxing providers. Example: [Modal](https://modal.com/use-cases/sandboxes).

## Memory

Memory is a store of agent's state history and interactions with tools and users. While RAG focuses on semantic-similarity retrieval, agent memory requires more sophisticated approach involving relevance in context, recency and application-specific criteria. One example of a memory system is [Mem0](https://mem0.ai/).
