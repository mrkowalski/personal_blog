+++

We're all constantly moving forward in time, it's just that we can't control the speed or direction.

A "time-travel-like" phenomenon is time dilation. It occurs when there's a significant difference in velocity or gravitational potential between two observers. It involves differences in the passage of time, but it doesn't allow for 'jumping' to different points in time.  It's more like a stretching or compression of time, rather than actual travel.

## Example 1

Let's say a ship travels to Proxima Centauri b, about 4.24 light-years away, at 99% the speed of light. Due to time dilation, while about 8.5 years would pass for those on Earth, only about 1.2 years would pass for those on the ship.

## Example 2

Another example is the clocks on GPS satellites, which have to be adjusted due to time dilation. Because the satellites are moving at high speeds and experiencing weaker gravity than clocks on Earth, their time passes slightly faster. This difference, while tiny, would cause significant errors in GPS location data if not corrected.
