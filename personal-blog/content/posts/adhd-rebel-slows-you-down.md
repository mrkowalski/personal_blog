Your ADHD makes you rebel rather than listen. You resist authority and guidance. It slows you down, because you do not take feedback. Without incorporating feedback, iterative improvement stagnates, and potential optimizations are missed.

## Key factors related to ADHD that contribute to difficulties in processing feedback

- **Attention Deficits**: Difficulty maintaining focus can impede the comprehension of nuanced or complex feedback.
- **Hyperfocus**: In some cases, hyperfocus on a particular approach can create resistance to alternative perspectives.
- **Emotional Regulation**: Difficulty managing emotions can lead to heightened sensitivity to criticism, even when constructive.
- **Impulsivity**: Acting without fully processing the feedback's content can result in dismissive or reactive responses.
